## EXAMINATION REGULATIONS

The Senate of the Federal University of Technology, Minna, approves the following Code of Conduct. Members of the Academic staff and students are expected to abide by the rules and regulations enunciated in the code of conduct. Only the Senate of the University shall amend the Code from time to time as the need arises. Any exception to the regulations shall be accepted only under extenuating circumstances and must be sanctioned by the Senate.

## ATTENDANCE

1. Attendance in lectures, practical classes, fieldwork and SIWES shall be regarded as part of the requirements for a successful completion of a course. A student shall record a 75 percent attendance in lectures and 100 percent participation in practical, laboratory exercises, class assignments, SIWES and fieldwork in order to qualify to sit a semester's examination.

2. Therefore, each lecturer shall be required to keep attendance for each course. The student shall be made aware of this and shall be informed on an on-going basis during the course how he or she is doing in the course with respect to attendance. The mode employed in keeping the attendance shall be the prerogative of each lecturer and/or the respective departments.

3. Exemption from the above rules on attendance shall be on medical grounds and shall be granted on submission of a certificate from the Director of the University Health Services. For reasons other than medical, Heads of Departments concerned in consultation with their teaching staff and ratified by the Dean must endorse student applications. Any student who fails to meet the above requirements in any one course shall carry over that course.

## STUDENT'S WELFARE

### (a) Handling of academic grievances

The students' academic grievances are normally channelled through the class representative and the respective level adviser to the Head of Department. The issue will then be discussed at the Departmental meeting, and where necessary, an ad-hoc committee may be constituted to look into the grievances. Issues that cannot be resolved at the Departmental level may be referred to the School Academic Board, where, with the permission of members, the Dean might set up a committee to look into the issue.

### (b) Students' academic advising

The Head of Department appoints one academic staff as an adviser to each level. Moreover, there is an intimate interaction between the students and the staff of the Department through the students' advisers. Consequently, the students have direct access to the staff and the Head of Department always ready to come to the assistance of the students, where and when necessary.

## LATENESS TO CLASS

Lecturers are expected to start at the exact time they are scheduled. Any student who is not in the class 15 minutes after the lecturer has started his/her lecture shall be deemed to be absent from that class. Also, the students shall wait for the lecturer for up to 15 minutes starting from the time the lecture is scheduled to commence. If a lecturer fails to turn up for lectures or is fond of lateness in attending to his lectures, the class representative should intimate the HOD Computer Science or the Dean SICT.

## MODE OF EXAMINATION

The following three types of assessment may be used to examine a course in Computer Science:

1. Practical examination  
2. Oral examination  
3. Written examination / E-examination

The particular mode of examination or combinations chosen shall be dictated by the type of course and shall be the prerogative of the lecturer and the department.

## EXTERNAL EXAMINATION AND ASSESSMENT

The examination questions are set and marked by the Course lecturer(s). The Department internally moderates the questions. Course lecturer(s) evaluate(s) and grade(s) the students' answer scripts using marking schemes and model answers, while the Head of Department carries out double-checking of the results submitted by the course lecturers. On request, the Department issues students their results after examinations have been approved by the Senate.

In the case of the final year degree examinations, the questions with solutions shall be sent out to the University appointed External Examiner for external moderation. Qualified External examiners (the proposed and the alternate) shall be nominated by the Head of Department and submitted to the University Senate for approval through the SICT school board. The approved External examiner shall be appointed for one academic session and may be reappointed for a maximum of three terms. Only when a qualified and appointable external examiner is not available from within Nigeria shall such appointment be extended to examiners from outside the country.

## CONDUCT OF EXAMINATIONS

1. Examination shall be conducted by the school. Invigilators shall be chosen by the School Examination Officer from among the academic and senior technical members of staff of the various Departments. For each examination, there is a Chief Invigilator, who is a senior academic staff among the invigilators. There shall be at least two invigilators for each examination and for examinations involving more than 50 candidates, one extra invigilator shall be required for each additional 25 candidates. No lecturer shall be allowed to be the Chief Invigilator for his course.

2. The functions of the various officers charged with the responsibility of conducting the examinations are defined as follows:

### SCHOOL EXAMINATION OFFICER

The School Examination Officer shall be not below the rank of Lecturer I, and shall be appointed by the Senate on the recommendation of the School (SICT) Board. It is his/her responsibility to:

1. Prepare the Examination timetable and assign Chief invigilator/invigilators to each examination.

2. Prepare attendance slips, attendance registers and receipts for all examinations.

3. Notify the Academic Officer in advance of all the materials that would be needed for each semester examination, e.g. answer booklets, answer sheets, graph papers etc., and to collect all these materials one week before the commencement of the semester examination.

4. Handover the envelope(s) containing the question papers to the Chief invigilator about 30 minutes before the commencement of any examination scheduled for the period.

5. Collect all the answer scripts, the attendance slips and attendance register from the Chief invigilator after making sure that the total number of answer scripts tally with the number of students present at the end of the examination. A receipt must be issued for all items collected from him/her.

6. Handover the answer scripts to the Departmental Examination Officer concerned with the examination after he/she has signed for them.

## CARRYOVER COURSE

No student is allowed to carry over any course in which he/she scored an "E" grade or above. Both the old and new grades in a carryover course shall be retained in the student's transcript and they will also be used in computing his/her CGPA.

## DEAN'S LIST, PROBATION AND WITHDRAWAL

1. Within any one semester, any student that registers a CGPA of 4.0 and above shall qualify to be on the Dean's list of exceptional students.  
   A letter shall be issued from the Dean's Office to inform the student.

2. If a student recorded a CGPA below 2.0 at the end of 100 Level, he/she shall be withdrawn from the Department. While if such a student is in 200 Level and above; he/she shall be placed on probation at the first instance (SP1) and if recorded consecutively for the second time; he/she shall be withdrawn from the University.

## COURSE REGISTRATION

The level adviser for each level is also the registration officer for that level.

Every course is assigned a Unit load that corresponds with the number of lecture hours per week required to complete the course during the semester. A course that requires two hours of lectures per week shall be assigned two Unit units and vice versa.

Students are expected to register the courses they are to offer in a particular semester/session. Carry over courses are registered first before the fresh courses for that semester.

The maximum unit a student is allowed to register for in a semester is 18 units and a minimum of 15 Unit units would be allowed in any semester. This means that the total number of Unit units for all courses registered for by any student during a semester will not exceed 18 or be below 15 units.


## DEGREE AWARDED

The nomenclature of the first degree awarded by the Department is **Bachelor of Technology (Computer Science)**.

## CLASS OF DEGREE

The class of degree obtained at the end of the undergraduate programme is classified as shown in Table 1:
