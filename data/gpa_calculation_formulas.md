## 1. Semester Grade Point Average (SGPA)

- **Description:**  
  SGPA measures a student's academic performance for a single semester. It is calculated by dividing the total weighted grade points by the total credit units registered in that semester.

- **Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{SGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{Credit Unit} \times \text{Grade Point})}{\sum (\text{Credit Unit})}
  \]

- **Examples:**

  - **First Semester:**  
    - Total Grade Points: 33  
    - Total Credit Units: 10  
    - Calculation:  
      \[
      \text{SGPA} = \frac{33}{10} = 3.3
      \]

  - **Second Semester:**  
    - Total Grade Points: 35  
    - Total Credit Units: 11  
    - Calculation:  
      \[
      \text{SGPA} = \frac{35}{11} \approx 3.18
      \]

## 2. Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA)

- **Description:**  
  CGPA reflects the overall academic performance across multiple semesters. It is calculated by dividing the total weighted grade points from all semesters by the total credit units accumulated over those semesters.

- **Formula:**  
  \[
  \text{CGPA} = \frac{\sum (\text{SGPA Semester Grade Points})}{\sum (\text{Total Credit Units})}
  \]

- **Example:**  
  - Semesters Included: First Semester, Second Semester  
  - Total Grade Points: 68  
  - Total Credit Units: 21  
  - Calculation:  
    \[
    \text{CGPA} = \frac{68}{21} \approx 3.24
    \]
