## Background of Federal University of Technology, Minna

Federal University of Technology, Minna, Niger State is a Federal Government owned university in Nigeria, established on 1st February, 1983. The vision of the university is to become one of Nigeria's leading Universities and a Centre of excellence, recognized nationally, regionally and internationally for its quality, pedagogy, and research, which is supported by visionary leadership, responsible citizenship, internal and external partnership and a unique value system.

As a specialized University, its mission is committed to the training of skilled and innovative workforce that would harness the forces of nature to transform Nigeria's natural resources into goods and services to positively affect the economy and thus the quality of life of her people. The University's objective is to give effect to the nation's drive for the much-needed self-reliance in Science, Engineering and Technology. The University's motto is **Technology for Empowerment**. The current Vice-Chancellor is Professor Faruk Adamu Kuta.

The University has two (2) Campuses: Bosso and Gidan-Kwano. The University runs a School system; an integrated unit of related disciplines with common academic interest in teaching and research. Presently, there are Ten (10) Schools namely:

- School of Agriculture and Agricultural Technology (SAAT)
- School of Environmental Technology (SET)
- School of Electrical Engineering and Technology (SEET)
- School of Innovative Technology (SIT)
- School of Information and Communication Technology (SICT)
- School of Life Sciences (SLS)
- School of Physical Sciences (SPS)
- School of Science and Technology Education (SSTE)
- School of Infrastructure, Process Engineering and Technology (SIPET)
- Postgraduate School (PGS)

A Dean and an Administrative head known as School Secretary, who works with the Dean and coordinates any administrative matter of the School, head each School.

# Department of Computer Science

The Department of Computer Science was established in 2009. It was created from the defunct Department of Mathematics/Computer Science with the aim that it is the backbone of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The Department offers a degree programme of Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech.) in Computer Science. The Department of Computer Science is one of the departments in the School of Information and Communication Technology (SICT). The Department offers a unique educational opportunity for students to achieve excellence through vigorous classes, practicals, and participation in cutting edge ICT research.

## BTech. Computer Science

### Overview  
The BTech. Computer Science programme teaches the essential skills of Computer Science emphasizing the core elements of Computer programming, System Analysis and Design, Networking, Software Development, Data Science and Futuristic Technology, demystifying and bringing patterns to life with practicals. Students of this programme are equipped with core courses in computing. The graduates of this programme will understand the impact of computing and its applications ranging from introduction to Problem Solving, Web development, Computer Programming, Hardware and Software design, Human Computer interaction and Data Science.

### Philosophy  
The philosophy of the Computer Science programme is to provide broad and high quality education that emphasizes the theoretical and algorithmic foundations of computing, which guide design, implementation and application of computation systems.

# Objectives

The specific objectives are to:

1. Create in students the awareness of and enthusiasm for Computer Science and its capabilities;
2. Provide students with a broad and balanced foundation of Computer Science knowledge and practical skills;
3. Prepare students to formulate real world problems in Computer Science, employ problem-solving skills and use appropriate tools and technologies to obtain valid and realistic solutions;
4. Develop in students the ability to analyze, evaluate and propose alternative solutions to given software and/or algorithm designs;
5. Develop students' abilities in self-management and teamwork;
6. Prepare students to be proficient, professional and ethical in their careers;
7. Prepare students to communicate effectively both orally and in writing; and
8. Develop in students the ability to engage in life-long learning and growth in Computer Science and to be potential job creators.

# Unique Features of the Programme

The unique features of the programme are:

1. Deliberate emphasis on coverage and developing competence on the usage of open source software;
2. Additional hands-on practical component in a number of courses to emphasise students' engagement in the learning process for better learning and development of soft skills; and
3. Emphasis on formal methods and algorithmic coverage of computing concepts and principles.
4. Employability Skills

# Employability Skills and Competences

In Nigeria, like in many other countries, there is an abundance of opportunities for people with computing skills. However, given the intense competition in the job market, a good Computer Science degree may be necessary but not sufficient for employment. In addition to a good degree, employers are increasingly requiring candidates to demonstrate employability skills such as communication and teamwork, organisation and management, critical thinking, leadership, technology skills and self-management. The courses in this programme have been tailored to help develop and enhance acquisition of these skills by graduates of the programme.

## 21st Century Skills

Among the 21st Century skills for the programme are:

1. Creativity  
2. Information literacy  
3. Media literacy  
4. Flexibility  
5. Social skills  
6. Problem solving  
7. Collaboration  
8. Global awareness  
9. Innovation skills  
10. Critical thinking  

## Competences of the Graduates

At the end of a successful completion of the B.Tech. Computer Science programme, our graduates should have the following abilities:

1. An ability to analyse a problem, identify and define the computing requirements appropriate to its solution.  
2. An ability to analyse the impact of computing on individuals, organizations, and society.

3. An ability to design, implement and evaluate a computer-based system, process, component, or program to meet desired needs.

4. An ability to apply mathematical foundations, algorithmic principles, and computer science theory in the modelling and design of computer-based systems in a way that demonstrates comprehension of the trade-offs in design choices.

5. An ability to live usefully with vision and entrepreneurial skills in this ICT age.

# Organizational Chart of the Department

The Department is headed by the Head of Department (HOD) who assigns duties and responsibilities to staff. The Departmental activities are guided by regulations approved by the University Senate and supervised by the Dean of School. The organisational structure is shown in Figure 1. The department uses a committee system with the departmental board as its highest decision-making body after the committees. The HOD chairs all meetings of the Departmental Board while the Secretary, appointed from the academic staff, takes the minutes, prepares and circulates them in readiness for the next meeting. Another staff member assists him/her.

Department staff are involved in decisions concerning departmental issues through participation at departmental meetings where these issues are deliberated on and suggestions made. The meetings consider and approve course allocations to academic staff, examination schedule and procedures, examination results, research areas, and other matters concerning the department.
