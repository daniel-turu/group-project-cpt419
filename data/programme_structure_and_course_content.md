# Programme Structure Overview

This outlines the academic progression and focus areas for each level in the Computer Science programme.

| Level      | Description                                                                                             |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 100 Level  | Covers foundational courses in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, General Studies, and introductory courses in Computer Science, Environmental Science, and Biology. |
| 200 Level  | Focus on core Computer Science courses along with Mathematics, Statistics, and Physics.                 |
| 300 Level  | Offers more Computer Science-specific courses and one General Studies course.                           |
| 400 Level  | In-depth Computer Science courses and practicals. Students undergo a 6-month Industrial Work Experience Scheme (SIWES) in the second semester. |
| 500 Level  | Detailed courses in Computer Science, seminar presentation, research project, oral defense, and external examination. |

### Notes for RAG Knowledge Base:

- Each level describes the academic focus and special features (e.g., SIWES in 400 Level, research in 500 Level).
- Useful for queries like:
  - "What courses are covered at 200 Level?"
  - "When do students do their industrial training?"
  - "What does the 500 Level programme include?"
