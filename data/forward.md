Computer science is a dynamic field of study albeit, with some fundamental and foundational courses which form the basis of the discipline. In light of this, this reviewed curriculum is prepared to ensure consistencies with the Nigeria Universities Commission Benchmark Core Curriculum and Minimum Academic Standard (NUC CCMAS) for undergraduate Programme in Nigerian Universities (2024). Special considerations were given to the naming and content of the courses while at the same time accommodating the creation of new courses in line with the current evolving areas of the discipline globally.

Bearing in mind the importance of security in all aspect of computing, more optional security courses from sister Department of Cyber Security Science were added in addition to the existing compulsory Computer and Network security course. Also, considering the fact that we are in the era of data and digital economy; with the need to make sense of the data being generated on a daily basis, the Data Mining course has been revamped and now offered at 400 level of the programme. The curriculum has 70% Global Course Structure and 30% Additional Core Departmental Courses with FUTM-CPT codes were introduced to provide solutions to local problems being encountered in computing discipline.

This new 2024-2028 curriculum edition maintains the total instructional hours and the total Units required for graduation as obtained in the previous editions. Therefore, the new curriculum does not overburden the students but seeks to make them well grounded in all the areas of the discipline.
