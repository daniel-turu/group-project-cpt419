### Notes for RAG Knowledge Base:

* Clearly distinguishes titles, personal names, qualifications, and honors.
* Supports queries like "Who is the Vice Chancellor?", "What are the qualifications of the Registrar?" or "Who holds the title of Visitor?"
* Honors and qualifications provide extra metadata to enhance search specificity and validation.
