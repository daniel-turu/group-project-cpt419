# Class of Degree and Corresponding CGPA Ranges

Understanding the classification of academic degrees based on Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA) is essential for evaluating student performance. Below are the standard classes of degree along with their CGPA ranges:

---

## First Class
- **CGPA Range:** 4.50 – 5.00
